a small mod that switches the modes in the Maps &Modes by pressing the F6 button (it turns the enabled modes off and the disabled ones on) (it works ONLY in Maps &Modes), it may not work the first time, the first mod I created for the crab game :D


before pressing F6, you must turn on/off any mode.
